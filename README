LogGen is a very simple script that helps sysadmins, users and else keep track of and document their work. 
While working on your project or a task, you can use LogGen to keep track of procedures and progress. 
The logs generated by LogGen can be useful as a reference or to pick up from where you left off the previous task. 
LogGen can be used in many ways, so I hope someone can find it useful. H@ppy h@(&!n8 :)

How do I run this script?
Just as you would do with any python script; open a terminal app, change directory (cd /path/to/file) 
to the script's location and type python LogGen.py. That's all there is to it. Enjoy!
